I’m Pavan, a CS student, which is pretty standard these days. What’s less common is how I tackle things. There’s a lot I don’t know yet, and that is something that excites me even more, any technology, i find interesting, i explore. I like backend dev, cause it literally enables me to build stuff, i want to use, a lot of my projects were built because of something i needed them for I’m not afraid to admit my gaps; instead, I see them as chances to grow. I’d love to bring this mindset to your backend intern role, contributing fresh ideas and a relentless drive to learn.
