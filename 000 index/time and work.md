If `A` does a work in `a` days then in one day `A` does 
`1/a` of the work.
If `B` does a work in `b` days then in one day `B` does 
`1/b` of the work.

This is assuming, they do uniform work everyday.
now if both of them combine, then in one day their combined work would be
`1/a + 1/b`

so basically assume they need n days to complete a work, that would mean after n days, 1 unit of work would be done right. so in one day, 1 / n units of work would be done. 

so basically, if they do a/b amount of work in one day, then it would take b/a day to complete the work.
