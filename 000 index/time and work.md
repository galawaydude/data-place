The core principle for all Time & Work problems is:
**Total Work = Rate of Work × Time Taken** *(this is mostly days)*
total work is just considered as 1 unit.

### **3 Core Methods to Solve Any Basic Problem**

Choose the method you find fastest. **Method 3 (LCM Method) is often the easiest and avoids fractions.**
#### **1. The Fraction Method**
- **Concept:** Total Work = **1 unit**.
- **Rate of Work:** If A takes `a` days, their rate is `1/a` of the work per day.
- **How to Solve:**
    1.  Find the daily work (rate) for each person as a fraction (e.g., `1/10`, `1/12`).
    2.  Add the rates for combined work: `1/10 + 1/12 = 11/120`.
    3.  **Time to complete = Reciprocal of the combined rate**: `120/11` days.

#### **2. The Percentage Method**
- **Concept:** Total Work = **100%**.
- **Rate of Work:** If A takes `a` days, their rate is `(100/a)%` of the work per day.
- **How to Solve:**
    1.  Find the daily work for each person as a percentage (e.g., `100/10 = 10%`, `100/12 = 8.33%`).
    2.  Add the percentages for combined work: `10% + 8.33% = 18.33%`.
    3.  **Time to complete = 100% / (Combined % per day)**: `100 / 18.33` days.

#### **3. The LCM Method (The Most Efficient)**
This method avoids fractions and complex decimals.
- **Concept:** Assume **Total Work = LCM** of all the days given.
- **How to Solve (Example: A-10 days, B-12 days):**
    1.  **Total Work** = LCM(10, 12) = **60 units**.
    2.  Calculate **efficiency** (work per day):
        -   A's efficiency = 60 units / 10 days = **6 units/day**.
        -   B's efficiency = 60 units / 12 days = **5 units/day**.
    3.  Add efficiencies for combined work: `6 + 5 = **11 units/day**`.
    4.  **Time to complete = Total Work / Combined Efficiency**: `60 / 11` days.

### **Advanced Concepts**

#### **1. Negative Work (Pipes & Cisterns, Destruction)**
- **Concept:** A task that undoes the work (like a leak in a tank or someone destroying a wall) has a negative rate.
- **Rule:** **Subtract** the rate of the negative work.
- **Example:** A builds a wall in 10 days (+10% per day), B destroys it in 20 days (-5% per day).
- **Net Work Rate:** `10% - 5% = 5%` per day.
- **Time to Complete:** `100 / 5 = 20` days.

#### **2. Work Equivalence (Groups of People)**
- **Use When:** You have groups of workers (Men, Women, etc.) and the work is defined in terms of Man-Days or a physical volume.
- **The Golden Formula:**
  `M₁ × D₁ × T₁ / W₁ = M₂ × D₂ × T₂ / W₂`
  - **M** = Number of Men (or workers)
  - **D** = Number of Days
  - **T** = Time per day (hours)
  - **W** = Work done (e.g., 40% of the project, or volume of a wall `L×B×H`)
- **Shortcut:** If a variable is the same in both scenarios (e.g., hours per day), you can ignore it in the formula.

#### **3. Efficiency**
- **Concept:** Efficiency is just another word for **Rate of Work**.
- **Key Phrases:**
    - **"A is twice as efficient as B"** means:
      - `Rate(A) = 2 × Rate(B)`
      - `Time(A) = 1/2 × Time(B)` (They are inversely proportional)
    - **"A is two times *more* efficient than B"** means:
      - `Rate(A) = Rate(B) + 2 × Rate(B) = 3 × Rate(B)`

#### **4. Equating Different Workers (Men, Women, Children)**
- **Goal:** Find a conversion ratio between worker types.
- **How to Solve:**
    1.  Calculate the total work in terms of each worker type (e.g., 8 men × 12 days = **96 man-days**).
    2.  Do the same for the other worker (e.g., 20 women × 10 days = **200 woman-days**).
    3.  **Equate the total work:** `96 man-days = 200 woman-days`.
    4.  Find the ratio: `1 Man = 200/96 Woman`.
    5.  Use this ratio to convert all workers in the final question into a **single type** (e.g., convert all men to their equivalent in women) and solve.
