Memory management is an important function of an operating system, its main goal is to allocate and deallocate memory space for processes, ensuring efficient utilization of memory resources, protection between processes, and enabling a high degree of multiprogramming.

### Some components

The CPU interacts with various memory components in a hierarchy.
*   **Registers (Regs):** Smallest, fastest, and most expensive memory, located inside the CPU. Used to hold data and instructions currently being processed.
*   **Cache:** A small, fast memory that stores copies of data from frequently used main memory locations. It's faster than main memory but slower than registers.
*   **Main Memory (RAM - Random Access Memory):** The primary storage where programs and data are loaded for execution. Much larger than cache but slower.
*   **Hard Disk Drive (HDD) / Solid State Drive (SSD):** Secondary storage, much larger and cheaper than RAM, but significantly slower. Used for persistent storage of programs and data.
