program is a passive set of instructions stored in a disk, a process is an active instance of a prgraom in execution

for each process, the os creates a ds
the ds has 4 main sections
stack, heap, data segments, text segments

local variabls, functionds calls, and return 

data segments holds the global variables, and static variabls, 
text segment holds the comp

each process, has the above ds

to manages all the processes, there is another ds, which is pcb(pcb is per process, or all the processesd)
