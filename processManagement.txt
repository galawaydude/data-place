What are the two primary, often competing, goals of an Operating System?;Convenience for the user and efficiency in resource management.
What is the fundamental role of an OS regarding computer hardware?;It acts as an intermediary, providing an interface for users to interact with the hardware, hiding its complexity.
What are the two main functions of the OS in resource management?;Resource Allocator (decides who gets what) and Comprehensive Manager (controls execution).
What is a "batch" in a Batch Operating System?;A group of jobs with similar requirements that are processed together sequentially without user interaction.
What major problem did multiprogramming solve compared to batch systems?;It solved CPU inefficiency by keeping multiple jobs in memory and switching to another job during I/O waits, maximizing CPU utilization.
What is the key difference between multiprogramming and multitasking?;Multiprogramming focuses on maximizing CPU utilization. Multitasking (time-sharing) is a logical extension that focuses on providing a responsive user experience through rapid process switching.
What is the defining characteristic of a Multiprocessing OS?;It has two or more CPUs (or cores) working in parallel, achieving true simultaneous execution of multiple processes.
What is the most critical requirement for a Real-time Operating System (RTOS)?;Tasks must be completed within strict, non-negotiable deadlines. The system's correctness depends on both the logical result and the time it is produced.
What is the difference between a program and a process?;A program is a passive entity (a set of instructions on disk). A process is an active instance of a program in execution, with its own resources (memory, CPU time).
What are the four main sections of a process in memory?;Stack (local variables, function calls), Heap (dynamic memory), Data Segment (global/static variables), and Text Segment (program code).
What is the Process Control Block (PCB)?;A data structure maintained by the OS for each process, containing all essential information about that process. It's the "passport" or "context" for the process.
What 8 key pieces of information are stored in a PCB?;1. Process ID (PID) 2. Process State 3. Program Counter 4. CPU Registers 5. Priority 6. Memory Management Info 7. List of Open Files & Devices 8. Protection Information.
What happens during a context switch?;The OS saves the state of the current process into its PCB and loads the state of the new process from its PCB.
What are the five primary states of a process?;New, Ready, Running, Blocked (or Wait), and Terminated.
What does it mean for a process to be in the "Ready" state?;The process is loaded into main memory and has everything it needs to run, but is waiting in a queue for its turn on the CPU.
In a system with 'N' CPU cores, what is the maximum number of processes in the "Running" state?;'N'. For a single CPU system, the maximum is 1.
What causes a process to move from the Running state to the Blocked (Wait) state?;It requests an event that requires waiting, most commonly an I/O operation (e.g., reading from a file).
What is swapping in the context of process states?;Moving a process from main memory to secondary memory (disk) to free up RAM. This introduces the "Suspend Ready" and "Suspend Blocked" states.
What is the "Suspend Ready" state?;A process that was ready (in main memory) is swapped out to secondary memory. It is still ready to run but must be brought back into main memory first.
What is the main role of the Long-Term Scheduler (LTS) or Job Scheduler?;To control the degree of multiprogramming by selecting jobs from the job pool (on disk) and loading them into main memory (placing them in the Ready queue).
What is meant by the "degree of multiprogramming"?;The number of processes kept in main memory (in the Ready queue). This is controlled by the Long-Term Scheduler.
What is the main role of the Short-Term Scheduler (STS) or CPU Scheduler?;To select one process from the Ready queue and allocate the CPU to it.
What is the main role of the Medium-Term Scheduler (MTS)?;To manage the degree of multiprogramming by swapping processes in and out of main memory (suspending and resuming them), often to alleviate memory pressure.
How frequently does the Short-Term Scheduler run versus the Long-Term Scheduler?;The STS runs very frequently (milliseconds), while the LTS runs very infrequently (seconds or minutes).
What is the specific job of the Dispatcher?;It is the component that executes the Short-Term Scheduler's decision. It performs the context switch, switches the CPU to user mode, and jumps to the correct location in the program to resume it.
What is Dispatch Latency?;The time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and start another running. This is pure overhead and must be minimized.
What is the key difference between the Short-Term Scheduler and the Dispatcher?;The scheduler *selects* the next process to run. The dispatcher *performs the action* of switching the CPU to that process.
When must the OS make a CPU scheduling decision? (List the 4 conditions);1. Process goes from Running to Terminated. 2. Running to Waiting. 3. Running to Ready (preemption). 4. Waiting to Ready (I/O completion).
What are the three main scheduling queues?;1. Job Queue (all processes in the system, on disk). 2. Ready Queue (processes in main memory, ready to run). 3. Device Queues (processes waiting for a specific I/O device).
What is Arrival Time (AT)?;The time at which a process enters the Ready Queue for the first time.
What is Burst Time (BT)?;The total CPU time a process requires for execution.
What is Completion Time (CT)?;The time at which a process finishes its execution.
What is the formula for Turn Around Time (TAT)?;TAT = Completion Time (CT) - Arrival Time (AT)
What is the formula for Waiting Time (WT)?;WT = Turn Around Time (TAT) - Burst Time (BT)
What is the formula for Response Time (RT)?;RT = (Time of First Execution) - Arrival Time (AT)
What is the formula for Throughput?;Throughput = Total Number of Processes Completed / Total Time
What is the formula for CPU Utilization?;CPU Utilization (%) = (CPU Busy Time / Total Time) × 100
What is CPU Busy Time?;The total time the CPU was spent executing processes. It is the sum of the burst times of all completed processes.
What is the formula for Inefficiency caused by context switching?;Inefficiency (%) = (Total Context Switch Time / Total Time) × 100, where Total Context Switch Time = (Time per switch) × (Number of switches).
What is the scheduling criteria and mode for the First Come First Serve (FCFS) algorithm?;Criteria: Arrival Time. Mode: Non-Preemptive.
What is the Convoy Effect in FCFS?;When a process with a long burst time arrives before processes with short burst times, causing the short processes to have a very long waiting time.
For non-preemptive algorithms like FCFS, what is the relationship between Waiting Time and Response Time?;They are equal (WT = RT). A process must wait for its entire turn before it ever gets to run.
What is the tie-breaker rule for FCFS?;If two processes have the same arrival time, the one with the lower Process ID (PID) is typically chosen first.
What is the main challenge of implementing the true Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm?;The exact CPU burst time of a process cannot be known in advance. It must be predicted.
How is the predicted burst time for SJF calculated using exponential averaging?;Formula: τ_n+1 = α * t_n + (1 - α) * τ_n, where t_n is the actual last burst and τ_n was the last prediction.
What does an alpha (α) value of 1 mean in exponential averaging for burst time prediction?;The next prediction will be equal to the actual length of the last CPU burst. It gives all weight to the most recent behavior.
What is Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)?;It is the preemptive version of SJF. If a new process arrives with a burst time shorter than the *remaining* time of the current process, the current process is preempted.
How does the Round Robin (RR) algorithm work?;It uses a FIFO queue and gives each process a small, fixed amount of CPU time called a time quantum. If the process doesn't finish, it's preempted and moved to the back of the queue.
What happens if the time quantum in Round Robin is very large?;The algorithm's performance approaches that of FCFS.
What happens if the time quantum in Round Robin is very small?;Response time improves, but the overhead from frequent context switching can significantly degrade overall system throughput.
How does Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) select a process?;It calculates a Response Ratio for each ready process and chooses the one with the highest ratio.
What is the formula for the Response Ratio in HRRN?;Response Ratio = (Waiting Time + Burst Time) / Burst Time
What problem does HRRN solve?;It is a non-preemptive algorithm that mitigates the starvation of long jobs (a problem in SJF) by considering how long a process has been waiting.
What is the main problem with Priority Scheduling?;Starvation (or indefinite blocking), where low-priority processes may never get to run.
What is "aging" in Priority Scheduling?;A solution to starvation where the priority of a process is gradually increased the longer it waits in the ready queue.
What is the core idea of Multi-Level Queue Scheduling?;The ready queue is partitioned into several separate queues (e.g., for system, interactive, and batch processes), each with its own scheduling algorithm.
What is the main disadvantage of Multi-Level Queue Scheduling?;Starvation is a major risk, as processes in low-priority queues might never execute if there's a continuous supply of higher-priority processes.
How does Multi-Level Feedback Queue Scheduling solve the starvation problem?;It allows processes to move between queues. A process can be demoted for using too much CPU time or promoted (aged) for waiting too long.
What is a CPU-bound process versus an I/O-bound process?;A CPU-bound process spends more time doing computations (long CPU bursts). An I/O-bound process spends more time waiting for I/O (short CPU bursts). A good scheduler balances both.
